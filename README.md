# BGP Simulator

Basic topological simulation for BGP-4 protocol. 

We construct the BGP AS graph using the existing AS topology data.
Each AS is represented simply as a **node** in a graph.
The main functionality is to find a path from AS a to AS b.

Using this basic simulator, we can test random deployment of any BGP or AS related projects.
